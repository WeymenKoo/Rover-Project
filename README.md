# Rover-Project
3D printed experimental rover that aims to be an environment for me to learn various skills:
- develop my CAD modelling skills
- experiment with DC motors
- designing circuits involving RC components
- designing mechanical parts
- explore PID control algorithm
- potentially implementing ardurover

# Known issues for Rover 3
- Motor will overheat
